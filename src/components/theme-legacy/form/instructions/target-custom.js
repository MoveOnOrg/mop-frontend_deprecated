    <h4>Choosing a Target</h4>
    <p>When deciding who should receive your petition, think about <strong>who actually has the power</strong> to solve the problem or make the decision you want. Please be sure to check the spelling and use the individual&rsquo;s proper title.</p>
    <p>If there are multiple people who may be able to solve the problem, focus on <strong>the person who is most likely to be influenced by public opinion</strong>. For instance, an elected official is usually a better target than an unelected judge.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s best if you <strong>send your petition to a human being</strong>. For instance, it&rsquo;s better to address your petition to Walmart CEO Lee Scott than Walmart the corporation.</p>
