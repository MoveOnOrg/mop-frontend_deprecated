# How to write documentation

1. Choose a topic and a type. Documentation in this project follows the standard described in https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/, i.e. all documentation should be explicitly declared as one of four types: Tutorial, How-to guide, Explanation, or Reference. Pick one. If you see a need for more than one on the same topic, just make separate focused documents and cross-link.
2. Name your document following the convention TYPE--title.md where TYPE is one of TUTORIAL, HOWTO, EXPLANATION, or REFERENCE.
3. Write your document using Markdown syntax.
